# Wishlist

- Formating whole script via hotkey
- Support for multiple languages(Only the API part, the coherent translations have to be shipped by native speakers)
- Replacing c4group usage by nodejs gzip stream preceding a custom transform-stream (to make things valid for gzip) and vice versa
- Xml based Documentation user-interface/any other way to create solid documentations for developers
- Scroll past end of ace document to give some ergonomic space (https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/wiki/Configuring-Ace)
