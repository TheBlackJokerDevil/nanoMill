# Beta (v0.9)
- ~~Solid keybindings API~~
- Saving and loading keybindings
- Moving files within and across workspaces
- Keep sorting when renaming/creating new files

# Stable (v1.0)

- Workspace settings(renaming, workspace specific c4group and ocexe)
- Navigating between modules by using 1-9 keys
- Controls to navigate in explorer and navigator with arrow keys
- Remove move-module icon from module head and replace it by dragging modules over another one for swaping

# Wishlist:

- formating whole script via hotkey
- Support for multiple languages
- Replacing c4group usage by nodejs gzip stream preceding a custom transform-stream (to make things valid for gzip) and vice versa
- Xml based Documentation user-interface/any other way to create solid documentations for developers
- Scroll past end of ace document to give some ergonomic space (https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/wiki/Configuring-Ace)
